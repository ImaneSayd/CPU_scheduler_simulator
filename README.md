# CPU Scheduler Simulator (part of the Operating Systems course in Cyprus International University) [Note : To be updated]
# Program Details
●	This project is part of Cyprus International University’s Operating Systems Course

●	The CPU scheduler simulates many different scheduling algorithms where inputs must be taken from text file with command arguments. And results also should be written to the output file and screen

●	Programmed using C language (without using arrays as challenge) and compiled on GNU/Linux Operating Systems

●	Supports the following CPU scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First (Non-preemptive/Preemptive), Priority (Non-preemptive/Preemptive) and Round Robin

# Important Notations
-t: Specifies the time quantum value. 

-f: Specifies the input file name. 

-o: Specifies the output file name.

# To Run the Code
Type in the terminal the following command: ./main -t <time_quantum_value> –f  <input_file.txt>  –o <output_file.txt>
